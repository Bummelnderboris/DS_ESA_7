Because of the consistence of this pattern it is assumed we need this disticntion, so changing the dtype to a date for columns like \"Date Event Began\" won't be a usefull strategy. This circumstance makes it a bit difficult to plot or analyse data because of non consistent data types in one column, so we have them stored as objects. Assuming we need to keep the information if a value is unknown, there are three different possibilities. We could (1) create a new column for the values with matching dtype. (2) We could include the solution in a query, for example with try and except. (3) We could asign nonsense values within the matching type to Unknown values.\n",
